# Frontend

Frontend is a microservice written in Golang which handles HTML templating and communication with other backend microservices.

This service is still very new. I'll improve the documentation when I have a better idea of what the structure will look like.

For now, Echo is used to handle routing and middleware, and the Go standard library templating package is used for HTML generation.
